My project is game database where it stores player information and items.
It will store the username and password.
It will store the Monster informations and the NPC informations.
And has a easy interface for the admin

You will be able to:
1. Create/Edit/Remove Players
2. Create/Edit/Remove Monsters
3. Create/Edit/Remove NPC
4. Buy stuff from the shop.
5. See the actions you did (if you created/edited/removed something)
6. Upload a picture and make it your background for the time logged in
7. Display player, monster and NPC list on the front page.
8. You will be able to see the player password and edit it.

NORMAL USER
If you login from the front-end, as a normal user.
You will be able to see the inventory of the player
